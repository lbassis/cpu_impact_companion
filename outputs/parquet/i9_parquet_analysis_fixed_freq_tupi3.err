[starpu][tupi3][_starpu_fxt_flush_callback] FxT is flushing trace to disk ! This can impact performance.
[starpu][tupi3][_starpu_fxt_flush_callback] Maybe you should increase the value of STARPU_TRACE_BUFFER_SIZE ?
Warning messages:
1: One or more parsing issues, call `problems()` on your data frame for details,
e.g.:
  dat <- vroom(...)
  problems(dat) 
2: One or more parsing issues, call `problems()` on your data frame for details,
e.g.:
  dat <- vroom(...)
  problems(dat) 
3: The following named parsers don't match the column names: Node, DependsOn

[starpu][tupi3][starpu_initialize] Warning: FxT is enabled, which slows down a bit, limits scalability and makes worker initialization sequential
[starpu][tupi3][_starpu_init_topology] Warning: there are several kinds of CPU on this system. For now StarPU assumes all CPU are equal
[starpu][tupi3][_starpu_initialize_workers_bindid] Warning: hwloc reported 32 logical CPUs for 24 cores, this is not homogeneous, will assume 1 logical CPUs per core

[starpu][tupi3][_starpu_bind_thread_on_cpu] and we were told to also bind active thread MPI to it.
[starpu][tupi3][_starpu_bind_thread_on_cpu] This will strongly degrade performance.
[starpu][tupi3][_starpu_mpi_progress_thread_func] [tupi3] No core was available for the MPI thread. You should use STARPU_RESERVE_NCPU to leave one core available for MPI, or specify one core less in STARPU_NCPU
