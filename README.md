This directory contains 3 sub-directories:
- outputs: containing the original output files used to write the paper
- plot_scripts: containing the scripts to create the plots, which should be invoked with `Rscript`. NOTE: your R installation must have the packages ggplot2, dplyr and RColorBrewer
- scripts: containing the slurm files so anyone can replicate the experiments and extract their own outputs
